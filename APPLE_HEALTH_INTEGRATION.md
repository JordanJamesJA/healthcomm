# Apple Health Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Apple HealthKit integration implemented in the HealthComm application. The integration allows iOS users to sync health data from their iPhone Health app, Apple Watch, and connected health devices.

## Architecture

### Service Layer

The integration follows the same architecture pattern as Google Fit, with dedicated services for platform-specific operations:

```
web/src/services/
├── healthKitService.ts          # Apple HealthKit-specific operations
├── healthPlatformService.ts     # Unified platform interface
├── vitalsSyncService.ts         # Data synchronization coordinator
├── bluetoothService.ts          # Bluetooth device management
└── types.ts                     # Shared type definitions
```

### Key Components

1. **healthKitService.ts** (NEW)
   - Singleton service for HealthKit operations
   - Device availability checking
   - Authorization handling
   - Data fetching for all supported vitals
   - Auto-sync functionality
   - Data parsing and unit conversion

2. **healthPlatformService.ts** (UPDATED)
   - Added Apple Health methods alongside Google Fit
   - `authorizeAppleHealth()` - Request HealthKit permissions
   - `syncAppleHealth()` - Manual sync trigger
   - `disconnectAppleHealth()` - Disconnect from HealthKit
   - `isAppleHealthConnected()` - Check connection status

3. **vitalsSyncService.ts** (UPDATED)
   - Added `connectAppleHealth()` method
   - Added `disconnectAppleHealth()` method
   - Updated `startAutoSync()` to include Apple Health
   - Updated `manualSync()` to sync Apple Health data
   - Added `syncAppleHealthData()` private method

4. **DeviceContext.tsx** (UPDATED)
   - Added `connectAppleHealth()` context method
   - Added `disconnectAppleHealth()` context method
   - Manages Apple Health device in Firebase

5. **AddDeviceModal.tsx** (UPDATED)
   - Added Apple Health connection mode
   - New UI for Apple Health authorization
   - Platform detection and availability checks

6. **types.ts** (UPDATED)
   - Added `isAppleHealthConnected` to SyncStatus
   - Added `appleHealthAutoSync` to HealthPlatformConfig

## Supported Health Data Types

The integration supports the following HealthKit data types:

| Vital | HealthKit Identifier | Unit |
|-------|---------------------|------|
| Heart Rate | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate | bpm |
| Blood Pressure (Systolic) | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBloodPressureSystolic | mmHg |
| Blood Pressure (Diastolic) | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBloodPressureDiastolic | mmHg |
| Blood Glucose | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBloodGlucose | mg/dL |
| Body Temperature | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyTemperature | °C |
| Oxygen Saturation | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierOxygenSaturation | % |
| Respiratory Rate | HKQuantityTypeIdentifierRespiratoryRate | breaths/min |

## User Flow

### Connection Process

1. User clicks "Add Device" in Patient Dashboard
2. Selects "Apple Health" connection mode
3. Reviews data permissions and requirements
4. Clicks "Connect Apple Health"
5. iOS presents HealthKit authorization dialog
6. User grants permissions for specific data types
7. App performs initial sync (last 24 hours)
8. Device added to Firebase with status "online"
9. Auto-sync starts (every 5 minutes by default)

### Data Sync Flow

```
iOS Health App → HealthKit → healthKitService → healthPlatformService → vitalsSyncService → Firebase
```

## Technical Requirements

### Capacitor Setup

```json
{
  "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0",
  "@capacitor/cli": "^5.0.0",
  "@capacitor/ios": "^5.0.0",
  "@capacitor-community/health": "^1.0.0"
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Info.plist Entries**:
   ```xml
   <key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
   <string>HealthComm needs access to your health data to monitor vital signs</string>

   <key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
   <string>HealthComm needs to update your health data</string>
   ```

2. **Capabilities**:
   - HealthKit capability enabled in Xcode
   - App ID configured with HealthKit in Apple Developer Portal

3. **Provisioning Profile**:
   - Must include HealthKit capability

### Environment Variables

```env
VITE_APPLE_HEALTH_ENABLED=true
VITE_APPLE_HEALTH_AUTO_SYNC=5
```

## Features

### Implemented

- ✅ HealthKit authorization request
- ✅ Read access to 7 health data types
- ✅ Initial data sync (last 24 hours)
- ✅ Auto-sync every 5 minutes (configurable)
- ✅ Manual sync trigger
- ✅ Device connection management
- ✅ Firebase data storage
- ✅ Anomaly detection and alerts
- ✅ Platform availability checking
- ✅ Unit conversion (Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.)
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ UI integration with connection wizard

### Not Yet Implemented

- ⏳ Background delivery (requires UIBackgroundModes)
- ⏳ Write access to HealthKit (only read access currently)
- ⏳ Workout data integration
- ⏳ Sleep analysis data
- ⏳ Nutrition data
- ⏳ Real-time notifications for health updates

## Security & Privacy

### HIPAA Compliance

- All data transmitted over HTTPS
- Health data encrypted in Firebase
- Access control via Firebase Security Rules
- Audit logging for data access
- User consent required for all data types

### HealthKit Privacy

- Users control which data types to share
- Permissions can be revoked at any time
- No data shared without explicit user authorization
- HealthKit data never leaves the device without user consent

### Best Practices

1. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only request access to data types actually used
2. **Transparent Communication**: Clear privacy strings explaining data usage
3. **User Control**: Easy disconnect and data deletion options
4. **Secure Storage**: Firebase encryption and security rules
5. **Regular Audits**: Monitor data access patterns

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. **Physical Device Required**: iOS Simulator doesn't support HealthKit
2. **Test Data**: Add sample data in iOS Health app
3. **Authorization**: Test first-time authorization flow
4. **Data Sync**: Verify data appears in Firebase
5. **Auto-Sync**: Wait for scheduled sync or trigger manually

### Test Scenarios

- ✅ First-time connection
- ✅ Re-authorization after permission changes
- ✅ Disconnect and reconnect
- ✅ Multiple data types syncing
- ✅ Data with different timestamps
- ✅ Empty Health app data
- ✅ Connection on non-iOS devices (should show error)
- ✅ Auto-sync interval functionality
- ✅ Manual sync trigger

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"HealthKit not available"**
   - Ensure testing on physical iOS device
   - Check iOS version (13.0+ required)
   - Verify HealthKit capability enabled

2. **Authorization fails**
   - Check Info.plist privacy strings
   - Verify App ID has HealthKit enabled
   - Reset permissions: Settings → Privacy → Health

3. **No data syncing**
   - Verify Health app contains data
   - Check date range (default: last 24 hours)
   - Confirm permissions granted for specific types

4. **Build errors**
   - Run `npx cap sync` after changes
   - Clean build folder in Xcode
   - Verify provisioning profile
